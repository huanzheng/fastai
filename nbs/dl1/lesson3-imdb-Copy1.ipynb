       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

Like in computer vision, we'll use a model pretrained on a bigger dataset (a cleaned subset of wikipedia called [wikitext-103](https://einstein.ai/research/blog/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset)). That model has been trained to guess what the next word is, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.\n",

Because the English of the reviews left by people on IMDB isn't the same as the English of wikipedia, we'll need to adjust the parameters of our model by a little bit. Plus there might be some words that would be extremely common in the reviews dataset but would be barely present in wikipedia, and therefore might not be part of the vocabulary the model was trained on."

       "  xxmaj directed by xxmaj stacey xxmaj peralta , a former z - xxmaj boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s xxmaj bones xxmaj brigade , and co - written with skateboarding photojournalist xxmaj craig xxmaj stecyk , this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from xxmaj southern xxmaj california 's mean streets ( known as xxmaj dogtown ) who formed the z - xxmaj boys skateboard team ( actually there was one girl -- xxmaj peggy xxmaj xxunk ) revolutionized skateboarding . xxmaj the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z - xxmaj boys ( xxmaj chris xxmaj cahill 's whereabouts are unknown ) with the most xxunk being bad ass xxmaj tony xxmaj alva and the youngest , xxmaj jay xxmaj adams , who 's talents ( along with xxmaj xxunk ) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams . xxmaj there are interviews of the team 's ( and the xxmaj dogtown shop ) founders , surfboard designer xxmaj jeff xxmaj ho , xxmaj skip xxmaj xxunk , and xxmaj craig xxmaj stecyk . xxmaj there are also interviews of folks like xxmaj tony xxmaj hawk ( obviously ) , xxmaj ian xxunk ( xxmaj xxunk ) , and xxmaj henry xxmaj rollins , who were young kids in the 70s when xxmaj dogtown was making it 's influence on skateboarding ( skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj it really shows you not only who the xxmaj dogtown team was and how they formed , but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks ( pool skating became xxunk popular , and thus gave way to vert skating ) , but also facilitated the sport ( though not into the extreme commercialism it is today ) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who 's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding . xxmaj the days of xxmaj russ xxmaj howell and xxmaj alan xxmaj xxunk were long over as the xxmaj dogtown , at least through the publicity of their skate team , paved the way for the new generation of skaters . xxmaj because xxmaj dogtown got all the attention , they were able to push skating to the next step . \n",

       "  xxmaj luchino xxmaj visconti 's film adaptation of xxmaj thomas xxmaj mann 's novella is visually , if not philosophically , faithful to its source ( xxmaj xxunk 's opera offers a more faithful reading of the xxmaj apollonian / xxmaj xxunk struggles which consume the aging writer ) . xxmaj it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made . \n",

       "  xxmaj in the xxmaj visconti version , the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story . xxmaj never has xxmaj venice looked more beautiful and alluring , more decadent and effete . xxmaj if you 've read the novella , it 's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life . xxmaj dirk xxmaj bogarde gives an outstanding performance as xxmaj gustav von xxmaj aschenbach . xxmaj although he has very little dialogue , he conveys the bitterness , aroused passion and finally , pitiful yearning of xxmaj aschenbach through facial expressions alone . xxmaj bjorn xxmaj xxunk , the young actor who plays xxmaj tadzio , the beautiful object of xxmaj aschenbach 's desire , was perfectly cast . xxmaj he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures . xxmaj the xxmaj tadzio character is pivotal to the story , so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire . xxmaj visconti , with his incredible eye for beauty , knew exactly what he was doing . xxmaj and changing xxmaj ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on xxmaj gustav xxmaj mahler , and then using xxmaj mahler 's music , especially the xxmaj xxunk from the 5th xxmaj symphony , was another brilliant stroke . xxmaj although i 'd read the xxmaj mann story before the film , xxmaj mahler 's music and xxmaj death in xxmaj venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind . xxmaj as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film , especially that last one of xxmaj ashenbach dying on the beach as xxmaj tadzio walks slowly into the sea . \n",
